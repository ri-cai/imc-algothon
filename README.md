**1st Place Novice, IMCity London Algothon 2026**

*A data-driven, multi-strategy approach combining external-data theoretical models, ETF arbitrage, aggressive directional trading, and Monte Carlo derivative pricing across 8 synthetic products tied to real-world London data.*

---

We built a fully automated multi-strategy trading system that computes **real-world fair values** from Thames tidal harmonics, weather forecasts, and Heathrow flight schedules, then deploys **six distinct alpha strategies** across all 8 competition products.

### PnL Trajectory

![PnL Trajectory](docs/pnl_trajectory.png)

The system maintained profitability throughout the entire session, never triggering the stop-loss at 250,000. The peak of 301,519 was reached at 03:19 UTC, with a trough of 237,260 at 09:58 UTC during a period of market dislocation before recovery to 283,033 at the final checkpoint.

### P&L Attribution

![Per-Product PnL](docs/pnl_attribution.png)

| Product | Profit | % of Total | Primary Strategy |
|:--------|-------:|:----------:|:-----------------|
| LHR_COUNT | +147,992 | 52.3% | Theo MM + Aggressive Directional |
| LON_ETF | +103,074 | 36.4% | ETF Arbitrage + Market Making |
| LON_FLY | +30,281 | 10.7% | Monte Carlo Derivative Pricing |
| TIDE_SPOT | +8,751 | 3.1% | Theo Market Making |
| LHR_INDEX | +1,583 | 0.6% | Cautious Market Making |
| TIDE_SWING | -1,258 | -0.4% | Accumulator |
| WX_SPOT | -2,716 | -1.0% | Theo Market Making |
| WX_SUM | -4,674 | -1.7% | Accumulator |
| **TOTAL** | **+283,033** | **100%** | |

**5 of 8 products were profitable.** Losses on the remaining 3 were small and controlled. The two dominant alpha sources (LHR_COUNT from flight schedule edge and LON_ETF from arbitrage) together account for **88.7% of all profit**.

### System Architecture

~3,200 lines of Python across 15 modules, organized into 5 packages (`theo/`, `data/`, `execution/`, `risk/`, `utils/`), with 3 external data API integrations, async execution infrastructure, and real-time SSE-driven order management.

## 2. Product Universe & Market Understanding

### Product Classification

| Product | Settlement Formula | Data Source | Strategy | Confidence |
|:--------|:-------------------|:------------|:---------|:-----------|
| TIDE_SPOT | \|tidal_level\| x 1000 | EA Flood Monitoring API | Theo MM | High |
| WX_SPOT | Temp(F) x Humidity(%) | Open-Meteo API | Theo MM | High |
| LHR_COUNT | Total flights in 24h window | AeroDataBox / RapidAPI | Theo MM + Aggressive | Very High |
| LON_ETF | TIDE_SPOT + WX_SPOT + LHR_COUNT | Derived (component sum) | ETF Arbitrage | Very High |
| LON_FLY | Piecewise derivative on LON_ETF | Monte Carlo simulation | Derivative Pricing | Medium |
| TIDE_SWING | Sum of 96 strangle payoffs on tidal diffs | EA Flood Monitoring (derived) | Accumulator | Medium |
| WX_SUM | Cumulative T x H over 24h | Open-Meteo (cumulative) | Accumulator | Medium |
| LHR_INDEX | Flight flow imbalance variance | AeroDataBox (derived) | Cautious | Low |

### Confidence-Proportional Sizing

![Strategy Allocation](docs/strategy_allocation.png)

Products naturally cluster into confidence tiers. We **sized positions and spreads proportionally to confidence**: tight spreads (2 ticks) and large positions (55 max) on high-confidence products, wide spreads (5 ticks) and small positions (15 max) on low-confidence ones. This prevents overexposure on uncertain products while maximizing alpha capture on our best signals.

| Confidence Tier | Products | Max Position | Half-Spread |
|:----------------|:---------|:-------------|:------------|
| Very High | LHR_COUNT, LON_ETF | 50 | 3 ticks |
| High | TIDE_SPOT, WX_SPOT | 55 | 2 ticks |
| Medium | TIDE_SWING, WX_SUM, LON_FLY | 20 | 3 ticks |
| Low | LHR_INDEX | 15 | 5 ticks |

## 3. Data Pipeline & Theoretical Value Computation

The core competitive advantage of our system is computing **fair values from first principles** using real-world external data, rather than relying solely on market prices. This section details each model.

### 3.1 Tidal Harmonic Model (TIDE_SPOT, TIDE_SWING)

**Approach:** Classical tidal analysis using 4-constituent harmonic decomposition, the same technique used in professional oceanographic prediction.

**Model:**

```
h(t) = H0 + sum[ Ai * cos(omega_i * t + phi_i) ]   for i in {M2, S2, K1, O1}
```

| Constituent | Period (hours) | Physical Origin |
|:------------|:---------------|:----------------|
| M2 | 12.4206 | Principal lunar semidiurnal |
| S2 | 12.0000 | Principal solar semidiurnal |
| K1 | 23.9345 | Luni-solar diurnal |
| O1 | 25.8193 | Principal lunar diurnal |

**Fitting:** Ordinary least-squares regression on a design matrix of `[1, cos(wt), sin(wt)]` for each constituent, fitted to **500 recent observations** from the UK Environment Agency Flood Monitoring API (Thames at London).

**Accuracy:** RMSE = **0.2958 mAOD** (early session) to **0.3228 mAOD** (late session), equivalent to ~296-323 tick uncertainty.

**TIDE_SWING derivation:** The model predicts tidal levels at all 97 timestamps (96 x 15-minute intervals). For each interval, we compute the height difference in centimeters and apply the strangle payoff:

```
diff_cm = |level[i+1] - level[i]| x 100
payoff_i = max(0, 20 - diff_cm) + max(0, diff_cm - 25)
TIDE_SWING = sum(payoff_i) for i = 1..96
```

### 3.2 Weather Model (WX_SPOT, WX_SUM)

**Data source:** Open-Meteo API (free, no authentication, 15-minute resolution)

**Settlement formula:** `WX_SPOT = Temperature(F) x Humidity(%)`

**Implementation:**
- Fetch 192 data points (96 past + 96 forecast) at 15-minute resolution
- Find the nearest forecast row to settlement time
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: `T_F = T_C x 9/5 + 32`

**WX_SUM:** Cumulative sum of `T(F) x H(%) / 100` over the full 24-hour settlement window. Split into a realized (historical, known) portion and a forecast (uncertain) portion, with confidence widening by 3.0 per remaining forecast interval.

### 3.3 Flight Schedule Model (LHR_COUNT, LHR_INDEX)

**Data source:** AeroDataBox via RapidAPI (Heathrow airport, LHR)

**Collection methodology:**
- 24-hour settlement window split into two 12-hour API calls (API max span)
- `withCodeshared=false` to count only operating flights (physical aircraft movements)
- Deduplication by flight number across overlapping API call boundaries
- **Disk caching**: flight schedules are deterministic, so we cache to `flight_cache.json` to avoid redundant API calls

**Final count:** **610 departures + 592 arrivals = 1,202 total flights**

**Cancellation adjustment:** Past flights count as 100% confirmed. Future flights apply a 1% cancellation rate:
```
theo = past_count + future_count x 0.99
```

**Confidence model:** `confidence = max(5.0, future_count x 0.3)`, which tightens toward zero as all flights become past (confirmed).

**LHR_INDEX:** Arrivals and departures binned into 48 x 30-minute intervals:
```
flow_i = 100 x (arrivals_i - departures_i) / max(arrivals_i + departures_i, 1)
LHR_INDEX = |sum(flow_i)|
```

### 3.4 Derived Products (LON_ETF, LON_FLY)

**LON_ETF:** Deterministic linear sum:
```
LON_ETF = TIDE_SPOT + WX_SPOT + LHR_COUNT
confidence = sqrt(tide_conf^2 + wx_conf^2 + lhr_conf^2)
```

**LON_FLY:** Non-linear piecewise payoff function on the LON_ETF settlement value `S`:
```
LON_FLY(S) = 2*max(0, 6200-S) + 1*max(0, S-6200) - 2*max(0, S-6600) + 3*max(0, S-7000)
```

This is a strangle-like structure with kinks at 6200, 6600, and 7000. We price it via **Monte Carlo simulation**:
- Draw 5,000 samples from `Normal(ETF_theo, (confidence/2)^2)`
- Compute payoff for each sample
- Fair value = mean(payoffs), Confidence = std(payoffs)

### 3.5 Theo Engine Architecture

- **Background daemon thread** polling all 3 external APIs every 60 seconds
- Thread-safe reads via `get_theo()` and `get_confidence()` protected by `threading.Lock`
- Graceful fallback: if any API fails, previous values are retained. If no data exists, conservative defaults apply

### Final Theo Values (Near Settlement)

| Product | Final Theo | Notes |
|:--------|:-----------|:------|
| TIDE_SPOT | 2,984 | 500-observation harmonic model |
| WX_SPOT | 4,482 | 15-min Open-Meteo forecast |
| LHR_COUNT | 1,202 | Exact count (all flights past) |
| LON_ETF | 8,668 | Sum of components |
| LON_FLY | 3,342 | 5,000-sample Monte Carlo |
| WX_SUM | 2,961 | Realized + forecast accumulation |
| TIDE_SWING | 591 | 96-interval strangle simulation |
| LHR_INDEX | 172 | 48-bin flow imbalance |

## 4. Trading Strategies

We deployed **6 distinct strategies**, each calibrated to the confidence level and settlement mechanics of its target products.

### 4.1 Strategy 1: Theo-Based Market Making

**Products:** TIDE_SPOT, WX_SPOT, LHR_COUNT

**Concept:** Quote both sides of each product around the computed theo value, with inventory-aware skewing to reduce directional exposure.

**Quote Pricing Formula:**
```
signal = clamp((theo - market_mid) / theo, -1, +1)
half_spread = spread_ticks x tick_size / 2
inventory_skew = -(position / max_position) x half_spread x 0.5
signal_skew = signal x half_spread x 3.0

bid = snap_to_tick(theo - half_spread + inventory_skew + signal_skew)
ask = snap_to_tick(theo + half_spread + inventory_skew + signal_skew)
```

**Position Sizing:** Dynamic scaling based on `1 - |position| / max_position`. Full size maintained for position-reducing (unwinding) direction. Signal-based bias: when signal > 0, bid size increases while ask size decreases.

**Divergence Safety:**
- If theo diverges > 5% from market mid: **blend** to 30% theo + 70% market (reduces risk from stale theos)
- If theo diverges > 10% from market mid: **circuit breaker**, stop quoting entirely

**Performance:** 599 passive strategy fills recorded in the main session.

### 4.2 Strategy 2: ETF Arbitrage

**Products:** LON_ETF vs TIDE_SPOT + WX_SPOT + LHR_COUNT

**Concept:** Monitor `LON_ETF` price vs the sum of component prices. When mispricing exceeds the minimum edge (1.5 ticks), execute a 4-leg arbitrage.

**Detection Logic:**
```
Case 1 (ETF Overpriced): edge = ETF_bid - (TIDE_ask + WX_ask + LHR_ask)
Case 2 (ETF Underpriced): edge = (TIDE_bid + WX_bid + LHR_bid) - ETF_ask
If edge >= 1.5 ticks -> execute arb
```

**ETF-First Execution Protocol (Novel):**
1. Execute the LON_ETF leg **alone first** via async aiohttp
2. If ETF fills zero, **abort immediately** (do not send component legs)
3. Only if ETF fills > 0, fire all 3 component legs **concurrently** via `asyncio.gather`

This eliminates the common arb failure mode: filling components but not the ETF, which leaves naked directional exposure.

**Volume Clamping ("Weakest Link"):** Volume is the minimum of: target quantity (2), position headroom across all 4 legs, and available book depth at each price level.

**Position Gating:** Arbitrage blocked when any leg exceeds 70% of max position (70 contracts).

**Scratch Routine:** When arb legs fill unequally, the system immediately generates **reverse IOC orders** at aggressive prices (2 ticks past best available) to flatten excess. Cost capped at 500 units per recovery.

**Performance:**
- 99 arbitrage opportunities detected and executed
- 333 individual legs filled (~3.4 legs per arb on average)
- 87 scratch recoveries for partial fills
- LON_ETF contributed +103,074 profit (36.4% of total)

### 4.3 Strategy 3: Aggressive Directional Trading

**Products:** Group A (TIDE_SPOT, WX_SPOT, LHR_COUNT, LON_ETF)

**Concept:** When the computed theo diverges from market price by more than 0.8%, place aggressive IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel) orders to capture the mispricing.

**Trigger:**
```
mispricing = (theo - market_mid) / theo
If |mispricing| > 0.008 (0.8%):
  If mispricing > 0 and position < 60% of max -> BUY at best_ask
  If mispricing < 0 and position > -60% of max -> SELL at best_bid
```

**Position Awareness:** Hard cap at 60% of strategy max position in the signal direction. Size scales down as position approaches the cap.

**Key Alpha Driver:** LHR_COUNT generated **+147,992 profit (52.3% of total)**, primarily from aggressive directional trading. Our flight schedule theo of 1,197 detected **persistent 3-5% mispricings** against market levels trading around 1,250. The market consistently overpriced LHR_COUNT relative to actual flight schedule data.

**Performance:** 305 aggressive IOC fills, predominantly on LHR_COUNT.

### 4.4 Strategy 4: Monte Carlo Derivative Pricing

**Product:** LON_FLY

**Concept:** Compute the fair value of LON_FLY's non-linear piecewise payoff using Monte Carlo simulation on the LON_ETF distribution, then market-make around it.

**Payoff Structure:**
```
LON_FLY(S) = 2*max(0, 6200-S) + max(0, S-6200) - 2*max(0, S-6600) + 3*max(0, S-7000)
```

**Implementation:** 5,000 random samples from `Normal(ETF_theo, sigma^2)`, averaging the piecewise payoff.

**Performance:** LON_FLY contributed **+30,281 profit (10.7%)**. Solid returns from a derivative product with limited competition, since pricing it correctly requires understanding both the ETF components and the non-linear payoff.

### 4.5 Strategy 5: Accumulator Products

**Products:** TIDE_SWING, WX_SUM

**Concept:** Lower-confidence products with path-dependent settlement. Conservative sizing with max_position=20 and wider spreads (3-tick half-spread).

**Performance:** Small controlled losses (-1,258 and -4,674). These losses are expected given the higher model uncertainty on path-dependent cumulative products and demonstrate that our confidence-proportional sizing prevented overexposure.

### 4.6 Strategy 6: Cautious Market Making

**Product:** LHR_INDEX

**Concept:** Lowest confidence product. Uses market mid price for quoting (not theo). Widest spreads (5-tick half-spread), smallest positions (max 15).

**Rationale:** LHR_INDEX depends on the sign of the cumulative arrival/departure flow imbalance, which can flip unpredictably. We quoted conservatively to capture bid-ask spread without taking large directional bets.

**Performance:** +1,583, a small positive P&L despite high uncertainty.

## 5. Risk Management Framework

Our layered risk management kept the system profitable through periods of market dislocation, never triggering the hard stop-loss.

| Risk Layer | Mechanism | Parameters | Status |
|:-----------|:----------|:-----------|:-------|
| Hard Stop-Loss | Halt all trading if PnL drops below threshold | 250,000 (checked every 30s) | Never triggered |
| Exchange Position Limit | Per-product limit enforced by exchange | 100 contracts | Active constraint |
| Strategy Position Caps | Tighter per-strategy limits proportional to confidence | 15-55 contracts | Active |
| Arb Position Gating | Block arb when any leg at >70% of limit | 70 contracts | Frequently active |
| Aggressive Position Cap | Stop building in signal direction at 60% of max | 30-33 contracts | Active |
| Circuit Breaker | Stop quoting when theo >10% from market | 10% divergence | Safety mechanism |
| Theo-Market Blending | Blend toward market when divergence 5-10% | 30% theo + 70% market | Active |
| Scratch Cost Cap | Skip scratch if reversal too expensive | 500 units max | Occasionally triggered |
| Emergency Unwind | Aggressive position reduction at limits | Triggered at abs(pos) >= 60 | 13 events |
| Cloud Reconciliation | Correct local-remote position drift | Every 120 seconds | Routine |

### Final Position State

![Position State](docs/position_heatmap.png)

At the final checkpoint, all positions were well within the exchange limit of 100. The largest position (LON_ETF at 71) was managed by the arb position gating mechanism.

### Key Infrastructure Components

**Rate Limit Management:**
- Token bucket rate limiter: 16 tokens/second with burst capacity
- Smart repricing: GTC orders only repriced when price drifts > 2.5 ticks OR order is > 60 seconds stale (avoids cancel-replace churn)

**Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler:**
- Group A products (TIDE_SPOT, WX_SPOT, LHR_COUNT, LON_ETF): **4x scheduling weight** each
- Other products: 1x weight each
- Result: Group A refreshed every ~5 seconds, others every ~20 seconds

**Async Execution Engine:**
- Dedicated asyncio event loop on a daemon thread with persistent `aiohttp.ClientSession`
- ETF-First protocol for arb execution
- Exponential backoff on 429 errors (1s, 2s, 4s retries)

**SSE-Driven Inventory Management:**
- Real-time position tracking from SSE `on_trades` callbacks (zero additional API cost)
- Cloud reconciliation every 120 seconds to correct any drift
- Double-counting prevention: fills only applied via SSE callbacks, never from execution reports

**Scratch Routine:**
- Immediately reverses excess exposure from partial arb fills
- Aggressive pricing: 2 ticks past best available to guarantee fill
- 87 successful scratch recoveries during the session

## 8. Lessons Learned

### What Worked

- **Flight schedule data** provided dominant, persistent alpha (52.3% of total profit). The market consistently overpriced LHR_COUNT.
- **ETF arbitrage** was reliable and profitable, with the ETF-First execution protocol preventing failed arbs.
- **Layered risk management** kept drawdowns controlled despite volatile market conditions.
- **Confidence-proportional sizing** correctly limited exposure on uncertain products.

### What Failed or Underperformed

- **Weather products lost money.** WX_SPOT and WX_SUM both finished negative. The weather theo was not accurate enough to market-make profitably — forecasts drift too much at 15-minute resolution. Next time: widen spreads further on weather, or don't trade them at all.
- **Tidal model degraded badly over the session.** RMSE went from 0.30 to 0.32 mAOD as we extrapolated further from training data. A 4-constituent harmonic model is too simple for an 8-hour extrapolation window. Should have refitted the model periodically using incoming observations.
- **Arb position gating left money on the table.** The 70% cap was too conservative — we blocked arb opportunities in the second half of the session when positions were already large. Should have dynamically adjusted the gate based on time-to-settlement and expected unwind cost.
- **No microstructure signals at all.** We traded purely on theo vs. market price. Order flow imbalance, book pressure, and cross-product momentum were all ignored. A lot of edge was sitting there unused.
